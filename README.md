# Fashin Image Recommender Bot.  Deep Learning Image Recommender System with ResNet50

The goal of this project is to create a sophisticated image recommender system that leverages the power of deep learning. The system utilizes the ResNet50 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network, to extract meaningful features from images and provide accurate recommendations.
